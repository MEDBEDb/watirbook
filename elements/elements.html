<h1 id="html-elements-supported-by-watir">HTML Elements Supported by Watir</h1>
<p>Different Watir gems support different HTML elements. For example, watir-webdriver gem supports all elements. Yes, all of them. Watir gem supports the most common ones, but as you will see later in the book, it is easy to extend it to support more elements. Safariwatir does not support a lot of elements, but it supports the most common ones.</p>
<p>Please take a look at <em>HTML Elements Supported by Watir</em> table in Reference chapter for more details.</p>
